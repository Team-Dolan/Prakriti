## Our Vision


We, at Prakriti, realise the paramountcy of preservation of nature and are also aware of the preponderance of profit making or prudence in any decision. Hence, we have come up with No Pile On Isle - an urban solution to the age old problem of Henderson Island. The efforts are not only required to undo the harm that we have caused, but also prevent any further deterioration.

Through this, we aim to spread awareness about the plight of the island. We bring to you everything that we have about it and promise to deliver credible and authentic information from various sources. From every penny of revenue generated from advertisements, endorsement, fund-raisers or from every click, we pledge to contribute it towards cleaning Henderson Island and standing true to our name - No Pile On Isle.

### TL;DR

A web application based solution to monetize and raise funding in pursuit to save diminishing islands and ocean life caused due to plastic pollution through our initiative.
